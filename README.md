# SVG Logo Generator

  ![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)
  ## Description
  Need a sleek logo for your company? Does your project require a swanky vector graphics emblem? Can the soul of your work be sumarized in three characters or less? Then this SVG logo generator is for you!

Choose from spicy triangles, sweeping circles, and bonking squares for your background, select any color you want for text and background, then type in what your project means to you. Once the majority of your prose is deleted to extract the first 3 characters, your logo will appear like a hopeful sunrise.

  ## DEMO
  For a complete demontration of my app, including testing, check out this video: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y5LR7LH3XLiinnc2k36moNWn9wxsSgsR/view?usp=drive_link

  One thing to note about the demontration: when making one of the logos, I didn't realize that 'lightred' is not a javascript color keyword, but it defaulted to black fill color, which is the expected behavior.

  ## Features
  When generating a logo, you can:

  - Choose from the Mighty Triangle, the Cunning Circle, or the Equanimous Square!

  - Select background and text colors by inputing a color key word, or a hexadecimal code!

  - Each logo generates with a time stamped name, so your logos never get overwritten!

  - No matter how much text you write, and how much you put your soul into your project, the logo will only ever take the first 3 letters/characters entered!

  - I use too many exclamation marks!

  ## Usage
  When you generate an svg logo, it will show up in the ./logos directory, with a time stamped title.
